## Projects
Here are a few projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

## Procedural Creature Generation

### Project Overview

This project utilizes the Blender Python API (`bpy`) to implement procedural content generation techniques. The script focuses on generating 3D meshes, specifically rings and legs, by calculating vertices in 3D space. The content is built programmatically using mathematical formulas to create intricate geometric structures, which can be applied in various 3D modeling or animation scenarios.

### Key Features:
- Uses **Blender's Python API** (`bpy`) for 3D content generation.
- Generates **rings** and **legs** through procedural algorithms based on trigonometric calculations.
- Supports customization of parameters such as radius and the number of vertices to control the complexity of the mesh.

### Future Improvements:
1. **Additional Geometric Shapes**: Extend the project to include other geometric forms, such as cubes, spheres, or more complex shapes.
2. **Texture and Material Generation**: Add functionality for procedural texture and material generation to complement the geometry.
3. **Animation Support**: Implement procedural animation techniques to bring the generated models to life.
4. **User Interface Enhancements**: Develop a Blender add-on with a user-friendly interface for easier control over generation parameters.
5. **Optimization for Performance**: Improve the script's efficiency when handling larger or more complex 3D scenes.

## Frozen Lake OpenAI (PSO-GA)

### Project Overview

This project implements optimization algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), to solve the FrozenLake problem from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to train an agent to navigate the FrozenLake environment and maximize its performance by optimizing the agent's actions through evolutionary techniques.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes **Particle Swarm Optimization** and **Genetic Algorithm** for optimization.
- Integrates with the **FrozenLake-v1** environment from OpenAI Gym.
- Includes performance evaluation using a custom fitness function based on the agent's rewards, falls, and steps.

### Future Improvements:
1. **Algorithm Performance Tuning**: Experiment with different optimization parameters to improve convergence speed and solution accuracy.
2. **Multi-agent Optimization**: Extend the project to include multi-agent optimization approaches.
3. **Larger Environment Sizes**: Scale the project to work with larger and more complex environments.
4. **Comparison with Other Algorithms**: Implement additional optimization algorithms like Q-learning or Deep Q Networks (DQN) for benchmarking.
5. **Visualization Enhancements**: Add more detailed visualizations to track agent performance over time.
